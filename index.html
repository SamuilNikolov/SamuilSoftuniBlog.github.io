<h2>Sofia - the social Robot?</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top fashion magazines.  Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.

                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance, auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.
                        
                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story.

    <h2>Smart data storage types needed for future workloads</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Different workloads have different storage requirements, and as those workloads evolve, storage must as well. The optimal media or infrastructure types will likely change over the course of data's lifecycle. Storage systems that offer the flexibility to present consistent data access despite these infrastructure changes simply offer the potential to better tailor the product to the workload and therefore offer more value. For example, off-premises public cloud storage offers different benefits than on-premises, but keeping public and private storage types isolated limits the benefits that can be achieved as business and workload requirements change.

                            Often, data storage products that can abstract the underlying storage infrastructure from the persistent data management layer are referred to as software-defined storage. The net result can be a storage system that incorporates a wide variety of data storage types, such as, on-premises solid-state, spinning disk on commodity hardware, and even tape, as well as multiple types of off-premises resources, while presenting a consistent level of data accessibility.
