<h2>Smart data storage types needed for future workloads</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                        Different workloads have different storage requirements, and as those workloads evolve, storage must as well. The optimal media or infrastructure types will likely change over the course of data's lifecycle. Storage systems that offer the flexibility to present consistent data access despite these infrastructure changes simply offer the potential to better tailor the product to the workload and therefore offer more value. For example, off-premises public cloud storage offers different benefits than on-premises, but keeping public and private storage types isolated limits the benefits that can be achieved as business and workload requirements change.

                        Often, data storage products that can abstract the underlying storage infrastructure from the persistent data management layer are referred to as software-defined storage. The net result can be a storage system that incorporates a wide variety of data storage types, such as, on-premises solid-state, spinning disk on commodity hardware, and even tape, as well as multiple types of off-premises resources, while presenting a consistent level of data accessibility.

                        It's obviously difficult to predict the optimal storage media type for a particular workload 10, or even 5, years from now. So, a storage software layer that offers the flexibility to support a variety of data storage types translates into greater value and should be a key consideration when selecting a storage architecture for your organization.
